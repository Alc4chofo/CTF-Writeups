# ensalada cifrada

**CTF:** Cátedra Ada Byron UAH (INCIBE)  
**Category:** Cryptography  
**Difficulty:** 35

## Challenge

A web page greets you as "Invitado" (Guest) and says you need to break the encryption to access the admin panel.

## Solution

### Recon

Three clues in plain sight: the challenge name "ensalada cifrada" (cipher salad) hints at Caesar's big brother — the Vigenère cipher. An HTML comment `<!-- IMPERIUM -->` gives the encryption key. And the page confirms a session cookie has been set.

### The cookie

Inspecting the request reveals:

```
Cookie: session=cetv=xcyeb
```

Looks like an encrypted `key=value` pair. Decrypting with `IMPERIUM` as the Vigenère key:

```
Ciphertext:  cetv=xcyeb
Key:         IMPE RIUM
Plaintext:   user=guest
```

### The attack

Encrypt `user=admin` with the same key:

```python
def vigenere_encrypt(plaintext, key):
    result, key_idx = [], 0
    for c in plaintext:
        if c.isalpha():
            base = ord('A') if c.isupper() else ord('a')
            k = ord(key[key_idx % len(key)].upper()) - ord('A')
            result.append(chr((ord(c) - base + k) % 26 + base))
            key_idx += 1
        else:
            result.append(c)
    return ''.join(result)

vigenere_encrypt("user=admin", "IMPERIUM")  # → "cetv=rlguv"
```

Set the forged cookie and refresh:

```js
document.cookie = "session=cetv=rlguv; path=/";
```

The page now welcomes us as Administrador and reveals the flag.

Flag: `FLAG{C0zy_And_S3cur3_Alg0r1thm}`

## Takeaway

The Vigenère cipher is a 16th-century polyalphabetic substitution — not real encryption. The key was leaked in the HTML source, the plaintext structure (`user=value`) was predictable, and the algorithm is trivially reversible. Same lesson as El Café Clandestino: if the client can forge their own session, the access control is broken.
