# Phantom Governor

**CTF:** Cátedra Ada Byron UAH (INCIBE)  
**Category:** Web3  
**Difficulty:** 350

## Challenge

A governance smart contract on Sepolia. The goal is to become a council member by reaching a power level of at least 900 and calling `joinCouncil()`, then claiming the flag on the CTF website.

## Contract Analysis

```solidity
function authorize(address user, uint256 deadline, bytes calldata signature) external {
    if (block.timestamp > deadline) {
        revert PhantomGovernorExpiredSignature();
    }
    bytes32 digest = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("PHANTOM_AUTH", user, deadline));
    address recovered = _recoverSigner(digest, signature);
    if (recovered != signer) {
        revert PhantomGovernorInvalidSignature();
    }
    canExecute[msg.sender] = true;
}
```

**Vulnerability 1 — Replay attack on `authorize`.** The contract checks the signature and deadline, but never records that a signature has been used. No nonce, no mapping of used signatures. This means any valid signature can be replayed indefinitely as long as the deadline hasn't expired. Even better: the `canExecute` is set for `msg.sender`, not for the `user` in the signature — so anyone can reuse someone else's valid signature to authorize themselves.

```solidity
function run(bytes calldata data) external {
    if (!canExecute[msg.sender]) {
        revert PhantomGovernorUnauthorized();
    }
    (bool ok, ) = module.delegatecall(data);
    if (!ok) { revert PhantomGovernorRunFailed(); }
}
```

**Vulnerability 2 — Unrestricted `delegatecall`.** Once authorized, you can set any module and run arbitrary code via `delegatecall` in the contract's storage context.

## Solution

### Step 1 — Replay attack to get authorization

Found a previous successful `authorize` transaction on Etherscan and extracted the parameters: `user`, `deadline`, and `signature`. Called `authorize` with those exact same values — since there's no nonce protection, the contract accepted it and set `canExecute[myAddress] = true`.

### Step 2 — Deploy the malicious module

Created a contract that mirrors `PhantomGovernor`'s storage layout exactly (this is critical for `delegatecall`) and adds a single function:

```solidity
contract MaliciousModule {
    // Storage layout must match PhantomGovernor exactly
    address public owner;                            // slot 0
    address public signer;                           // slot 1
    address public module;                           // slot 2
    uint256 public minPower;                         // slot 3
    mapping(address => bool) public canExecute;      // slot 4
    mapping(address => uint256) public power;        // slot 5
    mapping(address => bool) public isCouncilMember; // slot 6
    address[] private councilMembers;                // slot 7

    function setPower() external {
        power[msg.sender] = 1000;
    }
}
```

When called via `delegatecall`, `setPower` writes to `PhantomGovernor`'s storage slot 5, setting our power to 1000.

### Step 3 — Swap module and escalate

Called `setModule` pointing to the malicious contract, then called `run` with the `setPower()` selector (`0xcc61c5a7`). The `delegatecall` executed in `PhantomGovernor`'s context, writing 1000 to our power.

### Step 4 — Join the council and claim

Called `joinCouncil()` — with power at 1000 (above the 900 threshold), we're added to the council. Connected the wallet on the CTF website and hit "Claim award".

## Takeaway

Two classic Web3 vulnerabilities chained together. First, signature-based authorization without nonce protection enables replay attacks — any past valid signature becomes a universal key. This is exactly why EIP-712 exists and why signatures should always include a nonce that gets marked as used. Second, `delegatecall` with user-controlled modules is essentially giving anyone the ability to rewrite your contract's state. The storage layout matching requirement is the only thing that makes this non-trivial, but it's just a matter of reading the contract's slot assignments.
