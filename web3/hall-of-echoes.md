# Hall of Echoes

**CTF:** Cátedra Ada Byron UAH (INCIBE)  
**Category:** Web3  
**Difficulty:** 200

## Challenge

A Solidity smart contract on the Sepolia testnet. To get the flag, you need to register as a "hero" — which requires a score of at least 1000.

## Contract Analysis

```solidity
function setModule(address _module) external {
    if (msg.sender == owner) {
        revert HallOfEchoesUnauthorized();
    }
    trustedModule = _module;
}

function train(bytes calldata data) external {
    (bool ok, ) = trustedModule.delegatecall(data);
    if (!ok) {
        revert HallOfEchoesTrainFailed();
    }
}
```

Two critical vulnerabilities here:

**1. Inverted access control on `setModule`.** The function reverts if `msg.sender == owner` — meaning anyone *except* the owner can change the trusted module. This is almost certainly a logic bug (should be `!=` instead of `==`).

**2. Unrestricted `delegatecall` in `train`.** Once you control the trusted module, `delegatecall` executes your code in the context of `HallOfEchoes` — same storage, same `address(this)`. You have full control over the contract's state.

## Solution

**Step 1 — Deploy an attack contract.** Created a contract that, when called via `delegatecall`, writes 1000 to the `score` mapping for my address. Since `delegatecall` preserves the caller's storage layout, writing to the correct storage slot directly modifies `HallOfEchoes`'s state.

**Step 2 — Swap the trusted module.** Called `setModule` with my attack contract's address. Since I'm not the owner, the inverted check lets me through.

**Step 3 — Trigger the exploit.** Called `train` with calldata targeting my attack contract's function. The `delegatecall` executes my code in `HallOfEchoes`'s context, setting my score to 1000.

**Step 4 — Register and claim.** Called `registerAsHero` — the score check passes, I'm added to the Hall of Heroes. Signed the required message to the server and got the flag.

Flag: `flag{ZOa6rcwSASKbb4vdYLLBZvjCpyDKNrkM}`

## Takeaway

`delegatecall` is one of the most dangerous operations in Solidity — it runs external code with full access to the calling contract's storage. Combining it with a broken access control (`==` instead of `!=`) creates a one-two punch: anyone can swap in a malicious module and then execute arbitrary storage writes. This mirrors real-world exploits like proxy contract vulnerabilities, where an unprotected upgrade function lets attackers replace the implementation entirely.
