## Challenge

You're given an image of a USB Ledger wallet. The goal is to find a hidden mnemonic passphrase and use it to authenticate on a verification website.

## Solution

### Step 1 — Steganography: Extracting the QR

Opened the Ledger wallet image in StegSolve and extracted the alpha channel. Hidden in it was a QR code, along with a single line of binary data at the bottom of the image.

The page title contained a clue: `[700 306 528]`.

### Step 2 — Decoding the hidden line

The three numbers pointed to the binary data:

- **700** — the row number where the data line sits
- **306** — the starting pixel of the data
- **528** — the ending pixel of the data

Extracting and analyzing the binary between pixels 306 and 528 on line 700 revealed the data was a compressed payload. After decompression, it yielded 11 hex indices corresponding to BIP-39 wordlist positions — 11 of the 12 words of a mnemonic seed phrase. The 12th word was brute-forced as the BIP-39 checksum word.

### Step 3 — The mnemonic

The full 12-word seed phrase:

```

```

### Step 4 — Getting the flag

The QR code led to a verification page (`https://diy.byronlabs.io:8443/...`) that asked for the mnemonic passphrase. Entering the 12 words gave the flag.

Flag: `flag{0df18b125ccb258bcf84b0b4a5c144e7f47a334934de66ac57886f37984049ff}`

## Takeaway

A multi-layered challenge that chains steganography, binary analysis, and crypto wallet fundamentals. The key insight is recognizing that the `[700 306 528]` title isn't decoration — it's coordinates pointing directly to the hidden data. From there it's a matter of extracting the binary, decompressing it, and understanding BIP-39 mnemonic structure well enough to recover the full seed phrase.
