# Another elf is changing me

## Challenge

You're given `anotherelf` — a stripped 64-bit ELF binary that asks for a password.

## Solution

### Strings recon

Running `strings` immediately reveals the flag in plaintext:

```
Amazing! You've discovered the transformation algorithm!
Here's your flag: FLAG{AnELFisTouchingMyString}
```

But the binary won't print it without the correct password. Several base64 strings are also visible — five of them decode to decoy passwords (`hacker_1337`, `find_the_flag`, `crack_the_code`, `reverse_engineer`, `password123456`). None work. The important one is `dGhlRWxmSXNUb3VjaGluZ015U3RyaW5n` which decodes to `theElfIsTouchingMyString` — the comparison target.

### Disassembly

Tracing from `_start` leads to the password-checking function. It does three things: base64-decodes the stored string into `theElfIsTouchingMyString`, applies a custom cipher to your input, then compares the two with `strcmp`.

The cipher is a simple positional transformation:

```asm
mov    $0x1,%edx          ; i = 1
.loop:
mov    %edx,%ecx          ; ecx = i
add    -0x1(%rbp,%rdx,1),%cl  ; cl = input[i-1] + i
mov    %cl,-0x1(%rax,%rdx,1)  ; output[i-1] = cl
add    $0x1,%rdx
cmp    %rbx,%rcx
jne    .loop
```

In pseudocode: `output[i] = input[i] + (i + 1)` for each character.

### Inverting the cipher

Reversing the transformation is straightforward — subtract instead of add:

```python
target = "theElfIsTouchingMyString"
password = ''.join(chr(ord(c) - (i + 1)) for i, c in enumerate(target))
# password = "sfbAg`BkKejW[[_W<g@`]SWO"
```

Feeding that into the binary prints the flag.

Flag: `FLAG{AnELFisTouchingMyString}`

## Takeaway

Three layers of "defense" — base64-encoded target, positional cipher on input, and five decoy passwords — none of which survive static analysis. The flag was even sitting in the `strings` output from the start. The real challenge is understanding the transformation well enough to invert it. `objdump -d` and patience with x86 assembly is all it takes.
