## Challenge

> para navegar por el puerto 80

You're given `capture.pcap`. The challenge name and description point to unencrypted HTTP traffic on a legacy browser.

## Solution

### Reading the PCAP

The capture contains 62 packets — all TCP between `192.168.1.15` (client) and `192.168.1.100:8080` (server). Most of it is noise: matchmaking pings, telemetry posts with FPS data, ad banner requests, CDN image fetches. Typical gaming-app filler designed to make you scroll past the important part.

### Finding the flag

Packet #41 breaks the pattern. Instead of a `GET` to a game API, it's a `POST` to a legacy login endpoint:

```
POST /legacy/login HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=admin_gamer&pass=FLAG{Cyb3rGam3r2026_P4ssw0rd!}
```

The server responds with `Login successful`. The flag is sitting right there in the password field, transmitted in plaintext over HTTP.

The clues map directly to the solution: "Internet Explorer" → the `/legacy/login` endpoint, "port 80" → unencrypted HTTP where credentials are visible in the clear.

Flag: `FLAG{Cyb3rGam3r2026_P4ssw0rd!}`

## Takeaway

Any credentials sent over plain HTTP are fully readable to anyone with a packet capture. Filtering for `POST` requests or searching for keywords like `pass`, `login`, or `flag` in packet payloads cuts through the noise immediately. This is exactly why HTTPS exists — and why legacy login flows over port 80 are a textbook security risk.
