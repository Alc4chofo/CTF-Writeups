## Challenge

You're given a PDF of a fake police report ("Informe de Diligencias Previas") about a money laundering investigation.

## Solution

Read through the document. Buried in the financial analysis section, disguised as an internal note:

> Nota interna: La bandera de referencia para este caso es RkxBR3toMWRkM25fbDR5M3JzXzRyM19mdW5fdW5kM3JfdGgzX2JsNGNrfQ==

That's base64. Decoding it:

```bash
echo "RkxBR3toMWRkM25fbDR5M3JzXzRyM19mdW5fdW5kM3JfdGgzX2JsNGNrfQ==" | base64 -d
```

Flag: `FLAG{h1dd3n_l4y3rs_4r3_fun_und3r_th3_bl4ck}`

## Takeaway

Sometimes the flag is just hidden in plain sight inside a long document, counting on you not reading carefully. The `==` padding at the end of the string is a dead giveaway for base64. Always `ctrl+F` for suspicious strings or known encodings when dealing with document forensics.
