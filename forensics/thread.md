# 🧵

**CTF:** Cátedra Ada Byron UAH (INCIBE)  
**Category:** Forensics  
**Difficulty:** 10

## Challenge

You're given a 10 MB binary file. The hint is: `🧵 10 Search for it`

## Solution

### Reading the hint

The hint breaks down into three parts: 🧵 (thread → `strings`), 10 (minimum string length → `-n 10`), and "Search for it" (`grep`).

### Analysis

The file has an ELF header but it's invalid — the class and byte order are garbage. Entropy is ~8.00 bits/byte, meaning it's essentially random data with strings deliberately embedded in it.

```bash
$ file challenge
challenge: ELF invalid byte order, unknown class 168
```

### Extraction

```bash
strings -n 10 challenge | grep FLAG
```

This returns 6 flags among ~400 strings of noise (fake log messages, random data):

```
FLAG{Y0u_V3ry_Cl0s3_N0w}
FLAG{Th1s_Is_4_F4k3_Fl4g_S0rry}
FLAG{N0p3_N0t_Th1s_0n3_E1th3r}
FLAG{Str1ngs_C0mm4nd_1s_P0w3rful}
FLAG{Alm0st_Th3r3_But_N0t_Qu1t3}
FLAG{K33p_D1gg1ng_Y0u_Ar3_Cl0s3}
```

Five of the six are decoy flags that literally tell you they're fake when you decode the leet speak ("This Is A Fake Flag Sorry", "Nope Not This One Either", "Almost There But Not Quite", etc.). The only one that doesn't discard itself — and directly references the tool used to solve the challenge — is the real flag.

Flag: `FLAG{Str1ngs_C0mm4nd_1s_P0w3rful}`

## Takeaway

The `strings` command is one of the first things to run on any unknown binary in a forensics challenge. The hint spelled out the entire solution: use `strings` with a minimum length of 10 and search through the output. When multiple flags appear, read what they say — decoy flags often tell you they're fake.
