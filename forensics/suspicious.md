## Challenge

> ¿soy yo, o está rara la 📸?

We're given an image and told something's off about it.

## Solution

"Rara la foto" — the description is pointing straight at the image metadata. Ran `exiftool` on the image and checked the EXIF data. Under the "User Comment" field:

```
FLAG{Ex1f_D4t4_H1d3s_S3cr3ts}
```

Flag: `FLAG{Ex1f_D4t4_H1d3s_S3cr3ts}`

## Takeaway

EXIF data is the first thing to check in any forensics challenge involving images. Tools like `exiftool`, `strings`, or even right-clicking "Properties" on the file can reveal hidden data in metadata fields like comments, author, GPS coordinates, or custom tags. In real life, this is also a privacy concern — photos taken with phones often contain location data and device info that people unknowingly share.
