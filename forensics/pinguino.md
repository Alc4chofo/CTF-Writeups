## Challenge

You're given `surprise__1_.zip`, a tiny password-protected ZIP archive containing `surprise.txt`. The clue points to the SecLists repository and says to pick one of the smallest "10 million" lists.

## Solution

### Identifying the wordlist

SecLists has a family of password lists under `Passwords/Common-Credentials/` sliced at various sizes from the same 10-million-password dataset. The clue says to pick the smallest, which is `10-million-password-list-top-100.txt` — just 100 entries.

### Cracking the password

With only 100 candidates, a simple Python loop does the job:

```python
import zipfile

with open('wordlist.txt') as f:
    passwords = [line.strip() for line in f]

with zipfile.ZipFile('surprise__1_.zip') as zf:
    for pwd in passwords:
        try:
            zf.extractall(pwd=pwd.encode())
            print(f"Password: {pwd}")
            print(zf.read('surprise.txt', pwd=pwd.encode()).decode())
            break
        except RuntimeError:
            continue
```

Password cracked on attempt #16: `letmein`.

### The flag

Extracting `surprise.txt` with the recovered password:

Flag: `FLAG{wuh32dDdsSSDAihsdsi767whhdwo}`

## Takeaway

`letmein` ranks 16th among the most commonly used passwords worldwide — a dictionary attack cracks it in milliseconds with no GPU or specialized tools. Even basic ZIP encryption offers no protection when paired with a password that's in the top 100.
