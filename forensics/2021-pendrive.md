## Challenge

You're given a ZIP containing `image.img` — a pendrive image. Find the flag.

## Solution

### Identifying the image

The `.img` file is a FAT16 filesystem — a USB pendrive image, matching the challenge name. Browsing the filesystem reveals several files and folders, but nothing obvious.

### Finding the deleted file

Looking at the root directory entries, there's a deleted file: `SECRETO.ZIP` (22,338 bytes). The first byte of the directory entry is `0xE5`, which is how FAT marks deleted files. However, the FAT chain is still intact (clusters 3 through 13), meaning the data hasn't been overwritten.

### Recovering the file

Wrote a Python script to parse the FAT16 structure, follow the cluster chain, and reconstruct the deleted ZIP. Reading clusters 3→4→5→...→13 produced a valid ZIP file.

### Extracting the flag

Inside `Secreto.zip` was `Secreto.png` — an image with a "TOP SECRET" message in Spanish about a zombie virus. One of the lines reads:

> Empieza por los conocidos amigos y familia con la clave flag{IdontForget$$}

Flag: `flag{IdontForget$$}`

## Takeaway

Deleting a file on a FAT filesystem doesn't erase the data — it just marks the directory entry with `0xE5` and frees the clusters in the FAT table. If the clusters haven't been overwritten, the file is fully recoverable. Tools like `autopsy`, `foremost`, `testdisk`, or even a custom Python parser can do the job. This is the bread and butter of digital forensics.
