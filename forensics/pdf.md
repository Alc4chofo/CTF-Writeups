# ¿PDF?

## Challenge

You're given `malicious_invoice.pdf` — a suspiciously tiny PDF at only 961 bytes. Opening it shows a single page with "INVOICE #9921 - SUSPICIOUS" and nothing else. The challenge name says it all: is this really just a PDF?

## Solution

### Examining the PDF structure

Dumping the raw contents reveals that object 3 defines an `OpenAction` with embedded JavaScript:

```
<< /S /JavaScript /JS (app.alert(atob("VGhlIHJlYWw..."));) >>
```

Decoding the base64 payload gives the hint: "The real content is attached to the end of this file structure."

### Finding the hidden ZIP

Looking past the `%%EOF` marker, the bytes `50 4B 03 04` appear — that's the magic header for a ZIP archive. The file is a polyglot: PDF readers parse from the top and stop at `%%EOF`, while ZIP readers locate the central directory from the end of the file. Both formats coexist without conflicting.

Carving everything from offset 683 onward and treating it as a ZIP reveals two files: `flag.txt` and `loader.js` (a placeholder simulating a malware payload).

### Extracting the flag

```python
import zipfile
with zipfile.ZipFile("malicious_invoice.pdf") as z:
    print(z.read("flag.txt").decode())
```

Flag: `FLAG{P0lygl0t_F1l3s_Ar3_Tr1cky_Malw4r3}`

## Takeaway

Polyglot files are a real attack vector — a single file can satisfy multiple format parsers simultaneously. The embedded JavaScript `OpenAction` mirrors how actual malicious PDFs auto-execute code on open, and the hidden ZIP shows how malware gets smuggled past filters that only validate the top-level file type. Always check past `%%EOF` in PDFs and run `binwalk` or `file` to detect embedded archives.
