## Challenge

Track down the flag using the handle "Massive-Equipment393".

## Solution

### Recon

Started with a Google dork: `site:reddit.com "Massive-Equipment393"`. This turned up a post in r/CTFlearn titled "Playlist" containing a Base58 string: `49Rak48kGp7nJoUq9ofCX`.

The Reddit account linked to a Spotify profile with two playlists worth investigating: "My Playlists" and "My Playlists#3". Both had encrypted data hidden in them.

### Decryption

**Layer 1 — Base64 (My Playlists description):**

The playlist description contained a Base64 string: `MHhmdW57c3AwdDFmeV9wbDR5bDFzdF8=`

```
0xfun{sp0t1fy_pl4yl1st_
```
**Layer 2 — Base58 (Reddit post):**

Decoding the Base58 string `49Rak48kGp7nJoUq9ofCX` from the original Reddit post gave the next step:

```
pl4yl1st_3xt3nd
```

**Layer 3 — Acrostic cipher (My Playlists#3 tracklist):**

Taking the first letter of every track name in "My Playlists#3" spelled out:

```
3xt3nd_M0R3_TR4X}
```

### Flag

Combining all three layers (with the logical order, as it gives the previous part, like on the first part it says sp0t1fy_pl4yl1st_, and in the second pl4yl1st_3xt3nd, so logically we know it's the continuation):

```
0xfun{sp0t1fy_pl4yl1st_3xt3nd_M0R3_TR4X}
```

## Takeaway

A nice multi-platform OSINT chain — Reddit leads to Spotify, and the flag is split across three different encoding layers hidden in playlist metadata and track names. The Google dork was the key entry point; without it, finding the Spotify connection would have been much harder. Always check profile links and descriptions, not just the main content.
