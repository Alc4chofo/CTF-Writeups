## Challenge

> No soy un robot

The challenge name is a robot emoji with a question mark. The description says "I am not a robot." All of it points to one file: `robots.txt`.

## Solution

```bash
curl https://mecanica.byronlabs.io/robots.txt
```

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /secret_flag_location
```

Visit the disallowed path:

```bash
curl https://mecanica.byronlabs.io/secret_flag_location
```

Flag: `FLAG{R0b0ts_Txt_Is_N0t_S3cur1ty}`

## Takeaway

`robots.txt` is a public, unauthenticated plaintext file that anyone can read. Its purpose is to politely ask search engine crawlers not to index certain paths — it provides zero access control. Listing a sensitive path in `robots.txt` does the opposite of hiding it: it advertises the path's existence. The flag says it all.
