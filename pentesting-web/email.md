## Challenge

> Hello! I feel like I am forgetting to tell you something...

A simple webpage with just a heading and a cryptic hint. No visible flags, no interesting source code.

## Solution

The hint about "forgetting to tell you something" is a nudge toward HTTP response headers — metadata the server sends but browsers don't display on the page.

Opened DevTools, went to the Network tab, reloaded the page, and checked the response headers on the main document request. Sitting right there:

```
X-flag: FLAG{H34d3rs_C4n_B3_H1dd3}
```

Flag: `FLAG{H34d3rs_C4n_B3_H1dd3}`

## Takeaway

HTTP headers are invisible to casual page inspection but are one of the most common hiding spots in web CTFs. When a challenge says it's "forgetting" something, think about what the server communicates that isn't rendered on screen. Always check response headers, cookies, and custom `X-*` fields — DevTools is all you need.
