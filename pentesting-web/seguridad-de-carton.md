## Challenge

> No hace falta que busques la flag... Siempre la has tenido.

A "SECURE VAULT" web page with a password input, protected by what it calls "Advanced Client-Side Protection." Right-click is disabled and DevTools shortcuts (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, Ctrl+U) are blocked.

## Solution

### Bypassing the "protection"

The anti-debug measures are all client-side: `oncontextmenu="return false"` for right-click, a `keydown` handler blocking F12 and common DevTools shortcuts. None of these actually prevent viewing the source — just open DevTools before navigating to the page, use `view-source:` in the URL bar, or `curl` the page.

### Reading the obfuscated JS

The authentication logic is entirely in the browser. The JavaScript defines an array of hex-encoded strings:

```javascript
var _0x4f2a = ["\x76\x61\x6C\x75\x65", "\x67\x65\x74\x45\x6C\x65\x6D\x65\x6E\x74\x42\x79\x49\x64", ...];
```

Hex escapes are just an alternate way to write ASCII. Decoding the array reveals everything — including the password and the flag:

| Index | Decoded |
|-------|---------|
| 7 | `FLAG{JS_Obfuscation_Bypassed}` |
| 8 | `Correct! ` |
| 9 | `supersecret` |

The `check()` function compares input against `_0x4f2a[9]` (`supersecret`), and on success displays `_0x4f2a[8] + _0x4f2a[7]` — the flag. You don't even need to enter the password; the flag is sitting right there in the source.

Flag: `FLAG{JS_Obfuscation_Bypassed}`

## Takeaway

The challenge name says it all — cardboard security. The flag, the password, and the entire authentication logic are delivered to the user's browser in full. Hex-encoding strings is a visual deterrent, not a cryptographic one. Client-side validation is never security; it's just UX. Everything that runs in the browser belongs to the user.
