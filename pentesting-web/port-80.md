## Challenge

The description lists every standard HTTP method: GET, HEAD, DELETE, CONNECT, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, PATCH. Visiting the URL returns a "Status: Restricted" page saying "Your current request does not meet the necessary criteria for data transmission."

## Solution

The key phrase is "data transmission" — GET requests retrieve data, but they don't transmit it. The challenge is asking for a method that sends data to the server.

```bash
curl -X POST https://metodo.byronlabs.io/
```

The server responds with a success page:

```
Status: Authorized
Resource access granted. Data retrieved successfully.
FLAG{H34d3rs_C4n_B3_H1dd3n_T00}
```

Flag: `FLAG{H34d3rs_C4n_B3_H1dd3n_T00}`

## Takeaway

Web applications can behave differently depending on the HTTP method used. A resource that blocks GET might accept POST, PUT, or DELETE, potentially exposing unintended functionality. Penetration testers routinely check how endpoints respond to different methods — proper method filtering should be enforced server-side for every endpoint.
