## Challenge

The website greets you with a simple message:

> Welcome Guest!
> Only admins can see the flag.

## Solution

The hint is right there — "Guest" and "admins". The first thing I did was open Burp Suite to intercept the request and inspect what was being sent. Immediately I spotted a cookie in the request:

```
Cookie: role=guest
```

Since it was pretty straight forward, my first thought was changing it to:

```
Cookie: role=admin
```

Forwarded the request, and the flag appeared.

## Takeaway

This is a classic example of broken access control through client-side trust. The server blindly trusts a cookie value set by the client to determine authorization. In a real application, roles should be validated server-side, typically tied to an authenticated session — never stored as a modifiable cookie.
