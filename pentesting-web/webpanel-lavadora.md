## Challenge

An admin login panel titled "Inicio de Sesión Admin" with username and password fields.

## Solution

Nothing unusual in the source code, so I fired up Burp Suite and intercepted a login request. The body was straightforward:

```
username=e&password=e
```

Two raw input fields being sent directly — classic SQL injection setup. Tried the most basic SQLi payload in the username field:

```
admin'OR'1'='1
```

The server didn't sanitize the input, the query evaluated to true, and it logged me right in. The flag appeared on the success page.

Flag: `FLAG{d453d926-45d2-4e40-b5d3-6e97a1417caf}`

## Takeaway

This is textbook SQL injection — user input is concatenated directly into a SQL query without any sanitization or parameterized queries. The login check probably looks something like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='INPUT' AND password='INPUT'`, and injecting `admin'OR'1'='1` turns the WHERE clause into something that's always true. Parameterized queries or prepared statements would prevent this entirely.
