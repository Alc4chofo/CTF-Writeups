## Challenge

> eres humano?

The page returns a 403 saying only "authorized search engine indexing services" are allowed, and displays your rejected User-Agent string. The challenge name is Google's wake phrase.

## Solution

Spoof the User-Agent to impersonate Googlebot:

```bash
curl -H "User-Agent: Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)" https://socio.byronlabs.io/
```

The server responds with "Verification Successful. Authorized crawler detected." and reveals the flag.

Flag: `FLAG{Us3r_Ag3nt_Sp00f1ng_1s_Fun}`

## Takeaway

The User-Agent header is entirely client-controlled — the server has no way to verify that a request claiming to be Googlebot actually comes from Google. Real Googlebot verification requires checking that the request originates from a Google-owned IP range via reverse DNS lookup, not trusting a header value. One `curl -H` flag is all it takes to bypass this.
